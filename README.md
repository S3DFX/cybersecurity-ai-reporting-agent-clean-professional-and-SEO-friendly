Automated cybersecurity assessment agent using n8n + LLM to analyze scan data (Nmap, OSINT, CVEs) and generate SOC-grade security reports with remediation guidance.

# 🛡️ Cybersecurity AI Reporting Agent (n8n + LLM)

This repository contains an automated **AI-powered cybersecurity assessment agent** built using **n8n** and **LLM** technology.  

It takes raw or structured security scan data — such as:

- 🔍 Nmap network scan results  
- 🛑 Vulnerability scanner output (CVEs, severity)  
- 🌐 Web security findings (SQLi / XSS / etc.)  
- 🕵🏻 OSINT exposure data  
- ⚙️ Configuration audit information  

…and automatically generates:

- ✅ Executive summary  
- ✅ Asset & service mapping  
- ✅ CVE & risk analysis  
- ✅ CVSS scoring (estimated if missing)  
- ✅ Actionable remediation plan  
- ✅ SOC-style incident playbook tasks  
- ✅ Clean Markdown report (or JSON output)

---

## 🧠 **How It Works**

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
**Webhook Trigger** | Accepts JSON input with scan results  
**AI Agent Node** | Analyzes risks & generates structured report  
**Memory Node** | Maintains context across requests  
**Respond Node** | Returns SOC-style security assessment report  

If invalid or incomplete input is submitted, the agent responds with **exact data required** (e.g., Nmap output, CVE details, OSINT findings).

---

## 📌 **Example Output Summary**

> **High-severity CVE (7.5)** detected on a Linux host running SSH (22) and HTTP (80).  
> Mitigation: Patch system, limit SSH access, audit web exposure.

---

## 🛠️ **Prompt Used**

The agent was instructed to:

- Interpret cybersecurity scan input  
- Score risks using CVSS logic  
- Identify assets & vulnerabilities  
- Create SOC-formatted reports  
- Provide remediation timelines  
- Ask for correct data if input is incomplete  

---

## 🌟 **Why This Matters**

This project helps:

- SOC Analysts  
- Pentesters & Bug bounty hunters  
- Security engineers  
- Students learning cybersecurity automation  

It **does not replace analysts** — it enhances them by automating repetitive reporting work and enforcing professional structure.

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**

- PDF report export  
- Integration with Nessus / OpenVAS / Burp  
- SOC ticket auto-creation (Jira / ServiceNow)  
- Slack/Teams alerting  
- Threat intelligence enrichment (VirusTotal/Shodan)

---

## 📂 **Files Coming Soon**

- ✅ n8n Workflow JSON export  
- ✅ Example input data (Nmap + CVE)  
- ✅ Sample report output  
- ✅ Guide to deploy locally & in n8n Cloud
